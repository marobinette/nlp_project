# NLP Project

This repository contains CSV data files that are stored using Git LFS (Large File Storage) due to their size.

## Git LFS Setup

### Installing Git LFS

If you don't have Git LFS installed, you can install it:

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

**Windows:**

### Initial Setup

1. Initialize Git LFS in the repository:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Pull the actual data files (not just pointers):
   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```

### Working with Git LFS Files

All CSV files in the `data/` directory are tracked by Git LFS. When you clone or pull this repository, you may initially only see Git LFS pointer files instead of the actual data.

**If you see Git LFS pointer files instead of CSV data:**

1. Make sure Git LFS is installed and initialized:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Pull the actual files:
   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```

3. Verify the files are downloaded by checking a CSV file:
   ```bash
   head data/ipeds_100663.csv
   ```
   You should see CSV column headers and data, not LFS pointer metadata.

### Automatic File Fetching

To automatically download Git LFS files when checking out or pulling, configure Git:

```bash
git config lfs.fetchexclude ""
```

Or globally for all repositories:
```bash
git config --global lfs.fetchexclude ""
```

This ensures that Git LFS files are automatically downloaded instead of leaving pointer files.
